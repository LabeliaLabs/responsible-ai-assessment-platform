# In this model file, the user authentication system is completed to add the fact that a user is part of an
# organisation.
# A user is define by a username and email address. It s what the user will see when he wants to login
# (and his password)
# But a user can belong to multiple organisations through different memberships. This table Membership is used to
# create this relation. For example, for a user which belongs to 2 organisations, there will be 2 lines in the
# membership table, one with the user_id, organisation 1 id and the user role in this organisation, and the other
# with the same user_id, the organisation 2 id and the role of the user in this second organisation
# On the other side, for an organisation, it has multiple members
# Admin members of an orga can edit, add, delete members to the orga (if they are not already membership.role = admin
# of the orga) to avoid
# Admin members can not delete an orga if there are other members in the orga (see if only other admin member)
