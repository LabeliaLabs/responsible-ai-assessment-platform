        <p>{% trans "Obviously this tension is not new, certain risks are very real, and it seems to us that there is a general consensus on the fact that it is necessary to develop structuring and reassuring frameworks. You only have to type <i>AI and ethics</i> or <i>responsible AI</i> into a search engine to see the plethora of initiatives in this field. However, many of them are lists of cardinal principles, and do not offer a concrete, operational hook. How can we position ourselves? How to evaluate one's organisation? What should you work on to <i>comply</i> with these principles?" %}</p>
        <p>{% trans "It is on the basis of this reflection that we wanted to develop a tool that is intended for practitioners, useful and actionable as soon as possible. Give it a try and tell us what you think!" %}</p>
    </li></ul>

    <p><strong>{% trans "Who is this evaluation intended for?" %}</strong></p>
    <ul><li class="li-with-disc margin-10">{% trans "The self-assessment tool has been developed to suit (and hopefully bring something!) all organisations (companies, university laboratories, start-ups, specialised consultants, etc.) with activities in data science, AI, ML, etc. A data scientist, a team leader, or a technical director for example can complete the assessment. The tool also allows several users for the same organisation to be involved, for example to divide up the subjects." %}</li></ul>

We have chosen not to take up here the 7 themes of the report of the EU high-level expert group or of its ALTAI tool, but to prefer a breakdown that we hope will be more pragmatic, aimed at getting closer to the life cycle of a data science project. See it in use!" %}</li></ul>

    <p><strong>{% trans "Is the assessment fixed or will you change it over time?" %}</strong></p>
    <ul><li class="li-with-disc margin-10">{% trans "Yes, it will continue to evolve. From the very beginning of this project it was clear that it would be an iterative process, because it seemed unimaginable to work for a period of time, publish this work and move on to something else. The field evolves quickly, the perspectives are multiple (large companies, public organisations, small start-ups, specialised consultants, regulators...), it was going to have to start somewhere and improve over time. Now that the platform is online, however, it is not a question of making changes every week, otherwise the assessments in progress or just completed will be constantly obsolete. We therefore set ourselves a time constant of the order of a quarter or semester. In order to accompany these updates and make them a positive thing for users and organisations that have already evaluated themselves, the platform includes a migration functionality. This consists of <i>migrating</i> a given evaluation to the more recent version of the evaluation repository: all responses to unchanged elements will be retained." %}</li></ul>

At the end of 2020, the 50/100 threshold can be considered a very advanced maturity level." %} </p><br>

           <p>{% trans "The mechanism for calculating the score is relatively simple:" %}<br></p>
            <ul>
                <li class="li-with-disc margin-10">{% trans "with each version of the assessment we define a number of points for each response item of each evaluation element, as well as a so-called <i>importance weighting</i> calibrated to ensure that the theoretical maximum total is exactly 100." %}</li>
                <li class="li-with-disc margin-10">{% trans "for single response evaluation elements, the number of points of the selected item is retained, while for multiple response evaluation elements, the number of points of all selected items are summed." %}</li>

    <br>
    <p>{% trans "There is, however, a subtlety in cases where one is <i>not concerned</i> by certain evaluation elements and the risk universes corresponding to them. Indeed, it would be illogical to deprive the organisation of points associated with evaluation elements that do not concern it but which other organisations concerned by this risk can obtain. Similarly, it would be illogical to immediately obtain all possible points, at the risk otherwise of automatically having a very high score as soon as little is actually done. The mechanism for dealing with this point is as follows:" %}</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="li-with-disc margin-10">{% trans "If you are <i>not concerned</i> by an evaluation element, you are automatically awarded half of the maximum number of points for the element. The other half is added to a temporary variable, the <i>number of points that cannot be obtained</i>." %}</li>
        <li class="li-with-disc margin-10">{% trans "Once all the assessment items that do not concern you have been dealt with, an intermediate score is calculated by summing the points for each item. This intermediate score is therefore not out of 100, but out of an intermediate maximum = (100 - the number of points that cannot be obtained)." %}</li>
        <li class="li-with-disc margin-10">{% trans "This intermediate score is then <i>dilated</i> to be brought back to 100; dilated by a factor (100 / maximum intermediate)." %}</li>
        <li class="li-with-disc margin-10">{% trans "This mechanism is a compromise to ensure : (i) that not being affected by certain risks is taken into account; (ii) that the score of any assessment is always out of 100." %}</li>

        <li class="li-with-disc margin-10">{% trans "Why is the value of each response item not seen during the assessment? In studying several systems for evaluating professional practices in different sectors, it has become apparent that it is rather good practice not to show these values. The aim is to give priority to the content, and to limit the risk of distracting the user by constantly putting before his eyes the numerical elements that can lead to an attempt to <i>optimise</i> his answers." %}</li>
